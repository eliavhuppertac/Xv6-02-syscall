1. 
usertrap () at kernel/trap.c:67 is the function that called syscall

2. 
7, this is the value of SYS_exec as defined in syscall.h

3.
the value of the register is 0x22 which in binary is 0010 0010, that means that the spp [the 8th bit] is 0x0, so we are in user mode

4.
the assembly code is:   
    lw	a3,0(zero) # 0 <_entry-0x80000000>
meaning that num is stored in a3

5.
The kernel panics because we are trying to read the value at address 0x0 which is not loaded, so we get a page fault
This makes sense because we get error code 0xd (13) which is "Load page fault"

Note: This is not the kernel space! That begins at 0x80000000
